We now turn to establishing that the model-checking problem for \SLref
is decidable. To do so we extend the classic approach, which is to
reduce to \QCTLs, the extension of \CTLs with (second-order monadic) quantification on atomic
propositions. This logic is equivalent to MSO on infinite
trees~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LaroussinieM14}, and it is  easy to
express that a strategy (or the atomic propositions that code for it)
refines another one.
