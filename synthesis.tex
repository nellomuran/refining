In this section we show how our framework captures generalisations of
the classical \LTL synthesis problem to the context of nondeterministic strategies.

\subsection{Classical LTL synthesis}
\label{sec-ltl-synth}

We first recall the standard LTL synthesis problem as defined
in~\cite{pnueli1989synthesisshort}: consider a set of \emph{input
  variables} $I$ controlled by the environment and a set of
\emph{output variables} $O$ controlled by the system. In each round,
first the environment chooses a valuation of the inputs $i_k\in 2^I$
(called \emph{input}), and then the system reacts by choosing a
valuation on the output variables $o_k\in 2^O$ (called \emph{output});
an infinite word over $2^{I\cup O}$ is called an
\emph{execution}. The system has perfect recall, meaning that its
choices can depend on all previous choices of the environment, and a
strategy for the system is thus a function $S:(2^I)^+\to 2^O$. Given
an infinite sequence of inputs $w=i_0i_1i_2\ldots \in (2^I)^\omega$, we
define the execution $S(w)=i_0\cup o_0, i_1\cup o_1, i_2\cup o_2\ldots$ where,
for each $k\geq 0$, $o_k=S(i_0\ldots i_k)$.

The \emph{LTL synthesis problem} consists in,
given $I$, $O$ and an \LTL formula $\psi$ over atoms $I\cup O$,
synthesising a (finite representation of a) system $S:(2^I)^+\to 2^O$ such
that for all $w=i_0i_1i_2\ldots\in (2^I)^\omega$ it holds that $S(w)\models\psi$.
This problem is known to be
\2EXPTIME-complete~\cite{pnueli1989synthesisshort}, and it can easily
be coded in Strategy Logic: one builds a turn-based game arena $\CGS_{I,O}$ (which
can be represented as a \CGS, see Remark~\ref{rem-turn-based}) with
two players, E (for Environment) and S (for System) in
which first the environment chooses an input $i$, then the system chooses
an output $o$, reaching a position labelled with atoms $i\cup o$ and in which it is
the environment's turn to play. The LTL synthesis problem for $(I,O,\psi)$ can
then be solved by model-checking the \SL formula $\exists x (S,x) \A
\psi$ on $\CGS_{I,O}$. Note that this really solves the synthesis
problem as existing model-checking algorithms for Strategy Logic can
synthesise  witness strategies (when they exist) for strategy variables existentially
quantified at the beginning of the formula.
